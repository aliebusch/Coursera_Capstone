    "In order to perform a location due diligence, bars that are of the same type, and grouped by neighbourhood, can be used in an analysis of potential success. Since we need access to as many potential paying customers as possible, the demographic of the neighbourhood must be taken into consideration. The safety of both the customer and the operation of the business can be associated to crime rate in area as well. This means we need to analyze 4 data sources:\n",

    "1. The types of popular bars currently in the neighbourhoods\n",
    "2. The population of each neighbourhood\n",
    "3. The annual income of the residents of the neighbourhood\n",
    "4. The crime rate in the neighbourhood\n",

    "This Capstone Assignment will use the Venue information collected by Foursquare in order to determine the popular bars currently in the neighbourhoods. The analysis will also use the Neighbourhood Profiles data available from the City of Toronto Wellbeing Data Catalogue (http://map.toronto.ca/wellbeing/) to analyze the population, affluence and crime rate of each neighbourhood. The crime rate is based on robberies since this is the most important issue with owning a bar in Toronto. The boundaries of the Toronto neighbourhoods will be taken from the City of Toronto Open Data Catalogue - Neighbourhoods (https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#a45bd45a-ede8-730e-1abc-93105b2c439f)\n",

    "The first step will be to determine the popular bars currently in the neighbourhoods. Then the Wellbeing Data will be used to determine Neighbourhood Profiles. A map of Toronto will be created with the neighbourhoods outlined and overlayed with a color coding based on the Neighbourhood Profiles data. The popular bars will also be marked on the map. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results will be analyzed and the recommendation(s) for the location of a new bar will be provided in the report conclusion."
